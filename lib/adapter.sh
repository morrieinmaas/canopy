# The agent adapter contract.
#
# An adapter is a directory holding one file, `manifest`, of `key=value`
# lines. It tells canopy how to recognise one agent in a pane and how to
# put that agent back where it was. docs/adapters/contract.md is the
# document; this file is the only thing that reads it.
#
# Adapters are looked up by directory name, and the manifest's own `id`
# must agree with that name. One name, checked, rather than two names that
# can drift: an adapter copied into place under the wrong directory is
# caught the first time anything reads it, not the first time a pane fails
# to resume.
#
# The search order is $CANOPY_CONFIG/adapters before $CANOPY_STORE/adapters,
# so a user's adapter of a given id wins over a shipped one of the same id.

# canopy_adapter_keys
# The six keys, in the order the contract document lists them. Every key
# is required in every manifest; a value may be empty, a key may not be
# absent. Absent-means-default is how two readers of the same file end up
# disagreeing about what the default was.

# canopy_adapter_get <id> <key>
# Prints one key's value. Returns 1 when no adapter has that id, so a
# caller can ask whether an adapter exists. Every other problem is a
# broken contract rather than a missing one, and dies loudly: an unknown
# key in the request, an unknown or duplicated or missing key in the
# manifest, a line that is not key=value, an id that disagrees with the
# directory, a can_pin_at_launch that is neither yes nor no, or a template
# with no {id} to substitute into.
#
# The whole manifest is parsed and validated on every call, not just the
# requested line. A reader that stopped at the key it wanted would happily
# return a correct value out of a manifest that is wrong three lines
# lower, and the consumer that eventually trips over that line would be
# debugging the wrong file.
# canopy_adapter_expand <template> <value> [placeholder]
# The one place a contract placeholder is substituted. Every template key
# in the contract carries one, and more than one caller needs the same
# answer: the save strategy writes a pane's resume command, and
# reboot-check has to work out what that command would have been to tell
# whether the save on disk actually holds it. The same rule written out
# beside each caller is a rule that drifts, and this project has paid for
# that already.
#
# The placeholder defaults to {id} because that is what every template key
# but one carries. detect_draft is the one, and it carries {pane}, so
# `canopy adopt` passes it rather than growing a second copy of this loop.
