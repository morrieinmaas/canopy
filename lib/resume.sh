# The stagger wrapper that canopy puts in front of a saved resume command.
#
# Ten agent panes restored at once launch ten agents at once, and an agent
# is not a cheap process. The command resurrect saves therefore carries a
# small wait in front of it, so the launches spread out instead of landing
# together on a machine that has just finished booting.
#
# The wrapper ends up in the command line a human may later read in the
# save file, or type again by hand. That is why it is a plain `sleep` and
# an `&&`: whoever reads it should need no explanation and no lookup.
#
# The functions here are written together because they have to agree about
# that shape. One emits the wrapper, the other takes it back off.

# canopy_resume_stagger_prefix <pane pid> <@canopy_resume_stagger_ms>
# Prints the wrapper for that pane, or nothing at all when the option is
# exactly 0, which is how the feature is turned off rather than left
# emitting a wrapper that waits for nothing. An unset option, or one
# holding something that is not a number, takes the shipped default: there
# is nobody to report a bad value to from inside a save.

# canopy_resume_stagger_pattern

# prefix is a pane that silently comes back as a bare shell.

# canopy_resume_processes_option
# The value for @resurrect-processes: the list of saved commands resurrect
# is allowed to type back into a restored pane.
#
# Generated from the adapters canopy has rather than written out anywhere,
# so installing an adapter is what makes its panes restorable, and a
# machine with no adapters gets an empty list and leaves resurrect's own
# defaults exactly as they were.
#
# Two entries per command. The plain one is resurrect's own form, anchored
# by resurrect at the start of the saved command. The second is a regular
# expression for the same command behind the stagger wrapper, which the
# first would no longer match.
#
# Quoting is not decoration: resurrect splits this value with `eval set`,
# so the regular expression has to arrive as one word and anything a shell
# would act on has to stay inert. A command that is not a plain word is
# dropped rather than quoted harder, because the safe answer for a pane is
# to come back without its conversation and the unsafe one is to run an
# adapter's manifest as code.
