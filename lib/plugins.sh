# The vendored plugin store.
#
# Two files describe it, and they answer different questions:
#
#   plugins/VERSIONS   <name> <upstream-url> <commit>
#     Where each tree came from. This is the provenance record, and the
#     input to plugins/vendor.sh when a tree has to be produced again.
#
#   plugins/CHECKSUMS  <name> <digest>
#     What each tree looked like when it was vendored. This is what lets
#     doctor say "modified" rather than only "present", and it is a
#     separate file deliberately: VERSIONS is a three-column contract that
#     other tasks in this milestone read, and widening it to carry a
#     fourth, generated column is how a format drifts away from the thing
#     that documents it.
#
#   plugins/LOCAL      <name> <path>
#     Files written into a vendored tree after vendoring, by canopy install
#     or by the plugin itself on load. The digest leaves them out, so a
#     plugin that has run is still a tree that matches.
#
#   plugins/ARTIFACTS  <name> <platform> <url> <sha256> <member> <dest> <sha256>
#     Release binaries a plugin would otherwise fetch from the network when
#     it loads or runs. canopy install downloads each one for this machine,
#     checks it, and puts it where the plugin looks; doctor checks it again.
#
# Neither VERSIONS nor CHECKSUMS is consulted at tmux render time.

# start and again on every reload.
#
# It runs as the body of a run-shell, and talks only to the server that
# ran it: the socket in $TMUX, named with -S, never whatever server a bare
# `tmux` would find. The plugins' own scripts call `tmux` the same way, so
