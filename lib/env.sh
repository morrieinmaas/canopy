# these paths verbatim into a transaction manifest that outlives the
# process, and $tx/restore.sh resolves manifest paths against whatever
# directory it is later run from, so a relative value would produce a
# restore point that names a different file than the one canopy backed
# up. Absolutising would have to pick a cwd on the user's behalf, and
# canopy cannot know which one was meant; the XDG base directory spec
# calls a relative value invalid too. An empty value is not relative, it
# means unset, and falls through to the default below.

# The fallback runtime path is /tmp/canopy-<uid>, and /tmp is shared and

# first. Whoever creates a directory owns it and sets its mode, so an
# attacker who wins the race owns the directory canopy then writes its
# scratch files into, and can read them, replace them, or point their
# contents somewhere else through a symlink planted inside.
#
# Two halves, and both are needed. Creating it with mode 0700 closes the
# window when canopy gets there first. Refusing a directory that is not
# ours, or that anyone else can write to, closes the window when it does
# not: mkdir -p is silent about a path that already exists, so without the
# check canopy would simply adopt whatever it found.

# Called at the point of use rather than from canopy_paths: resolving a
# path should not create a directory, and a command that never writes a
